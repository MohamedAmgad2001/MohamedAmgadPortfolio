        <p class="info">
          I am Mohamed Amgad, a dedicated and driven backend developer with a
          Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from
          Helwan University, where I graduated in 2024 with a very good GPA.
          During my academic journey, I gained a strong foundation in
          programming, algorithms, and software engineering principles. My main
          focus is on backend development, and I specialize in working with PHP
          and Laravel. Over the course of my studies and early career, I have
          developed a passion for creating robust, scalable, and efficient
          server-side applications. I have hands-on experience building dynamic
          web applications and working with databases to ensure seamless data
          handling and security. My expertise in Laravel allows me to build
          powerful and maintainable applications while following best practices
          in coding standards, version control, and API development. I am
          constantly seeking new ways to enhance my skills and stay up-to-date
          with the latest trends in backend technologies. As I continue to grow
          professionally, I am eager to join a large, innovative company where I
          can contribute to impactful projects and collaborate with talented
          teams. I am looking for an opportunity where I can apply my backend
          development skills, learn from experienced professionals, and
          contribute to the success of the organization while expanding my
          knowledge and expertise in the field of software development. My
          ultimate goal is to become a key player in building high-performance
          systems that drive business success.
